For this assignment, I programmed the Fraction class.

This class represent Fraction objects, storing numerators and denominators. It supports
operations between fractions and whole numbers, outputting the fraction in various forms,
and always storing the fraction in reduced form. The class supports negative fractions,
improper fractions, and whole numbers.
